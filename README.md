# HCT at UVA

This is the github repository for the [HCT at UVA website](https://hai-lab-uva.github.io/uvahct). The site is built using a theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) called [Ed](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/). Please visit the [main site](https://hai-lab-uva.github.io/uvahct) for more information about the cohort and its members. 

## Editing the website
* Upcoming and past talks can be placed as markdown files under /_upcomingtalks or /_pasttalks, respectively. Each will be displayed in a list on the home page. Delete placeholder.md when there are actually talks to display.
* Each page shown in the sidebar has a markdown file in the root directory. To edit these pages, edit these markdown files. To add or remove pages, add or remove the markdown files.
* For any other issues, please consult the [Ed documentation](https://minicomp.github.io/ed/).
